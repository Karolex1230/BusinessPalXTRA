    </p>

    <h2>4. Subscription Services</h2>
    <p>
      Subscription-based services are billed monthly and may include development, updates,
      and support as agreed. BusinessPal reserves the right to amend or terminate subscriptions
      with reasonable notice where necessary.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Maintenance & Support</h2>
    <p>
      Maintenance services cover reasonable updates and fixes related to the original build.
      Major changes, new features, or third-party issues fall outside standard maintenance
      and may require a separate agreement.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Client Responsibilities</h2>

      Clients are responsible for supplying accurate content, ensuring ownership or licensing

    </p>

    <h2>7. Payments & Fees</h2>
    <p>
      All pricing is agreed in advance. Payments must be made within agreed terms.
      Late or missed payments may result in suspension of services.

    </p>

    <h2>8. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>
      Upon full payment, clients receive rights to the final delivered website.
      BusinessPal retains ownership of internal tools, reusable code, and the right
      to display completed work in portfolios and promotional material.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Data Protection & GDPR</h2>

    </p>

    <h2>10. Liability & Limitations</h2>
    <p>
      BusinessPal provides services in good faith and to a professional standard.
      No guarantees are made regarding business performance, search rankings,

	<h2>Advertisement & Sponsorship Policy</h2>

<h3>1. Scope of Advertising Services</h3>
<p>
  BusinessPal provides digital advertising placement through logo display,
  branding visibility, and outbound links on designated pages of the website.
  Advertising services are limited strictly to the placements described at the
  time of subscription and do not include promotional guarantees, traffic quotas,
  or conversion commitments unless explicitly agreed in writing.
</p>

<h3>2. Eligibility & Content Standards</h3>
<p>
  All advertisers must represent a legitimate business, service, or brand.
  BusinessPal reserves the right to refuse, remove, or decline any advertisement
  that is deemed inappropriate, misleading, illegal, unethical, or damaging to
  the reputation of the platform.
</p>
<p>
  Prohibited content includes, but is not limited to:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Illegal goods or services</li>
  <li>Adult, explicit, or sexually suggestive material</li>
  <li>Hate speech, discrimination, or extremist content</li>
  <li>False claims, scams, or deceptive practices</li>
  <li>Malware, phishing, or unsafe external links</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Placement & Visual Presentation</h3>
<p>
  Advertisements are displayed in tiered placements based on the selected
  subscription plan (Standard, Featured, Premium, or Master Rank).
  Each tier includes specific visual treatments such as border styling,
  highlight effects, and placement priority.
</p>
<p>
  BusinessPal retains full control over layout, spacing, sizing, and positioning
  to maintain design consistency and user experience. Advertisers may not
  request custom placement outside the defined tier structure.
</p>

<h3>4. Logo & Brand Asset Requirements</h3>
<p>
  Advertisers must supply high-quality logo files in accepted formats
  (PNG, SVG, or JPG). Logos must be clear, legible, and free of excessive text.
  BusinessPal reserves the right to resize or adjust logos to ensure visual balance.
</p>
<p>
  Logos that are pixelated, low-resolution, or visually disruptive may be rejected
  or require resubmission.
</p>

<h3>5. Subscription & Billing</h3>
<p>
  Advertising placements operate on a recurring monthly subscription basis.
  Payments must be received in full prior to advertisement activation.
  Failure to maintain payment will result in suspension or removal of the advertisement.
</p>
<p>
  All fees are non-refundable once a placement period has begun.
  Subscription pricing may change with notice; existing advertisers will be informed
  in advance of any pricing adjustments.
</p>

<h3>6. Cancellation & Removal</h3>
<p>
  Advertisers may cancel their subscription at any time; however, cancellations
  take effect at the end of the current billing cycle.
  No partial refunds are issued for unused time.
</p>
<p>
  BusinessPal reserves the right to immediately remove any advertisement that
  violates policy, poses legal risk, or negatively impacts platform integrity.
</p>

<h3>7. Exclusive & Limited Placements</h3>
<p>
  Certain advertising tiers, including Master Rank, are limited to a single advertiser.
  Once occupied, these placements are unavailable until vacated.
  BusinessPal makes no guarantees regarding exclusivity beyond the explicitly stated tier.
</p>

<h3>8. Performance Disclaimer</h3>
<p>
  BusinessPal does not guarantee traffic volume, engagement rates, lead generation,
  or sales performance. Advertising effectiveness depends on external factors
  beyond BusinessPal’s control, including user behavior and market conditions.
</p>

<h3>9. External Links & Liability</h3>
<p>
  Advertisements may include outbound links to third-party websites.
  BusinessPal is not responsible for the content, security, or practices of
  external sites and assumes no liability for user interactions beyond its domain.
</p>

<h3>10. Modifications to Advertising Policy</h3>
<p>
  BusinessPal reserves the right to update or modify this advertising policy at any time.
  Continued participation in advertising services constitutes acceptance of
  the most current version of this policy.
</p>

<h3>11. Acceptance of Terms</h3>
<p>
  By purchasing or engaging in advertising services with BusinessPal,
  the advertiser confirms they have read, understood, and agreed to all terms
  outlined in this policy. This policy forms a binding agreement governing
  all advertising-related activities.
</p>

<h2>12. Game-Based Promotions & Reward Verification</h2>
<p>
  From time to time, BusinessPal may offer promotional incentives or rewards
  linked to interactive content or games hosted on the BusinessPal website.
  These promotions are provided for entertainment and demonstration purposes only.
</p>

<p>
  Any claim for a reward, including but not limited to a free website build,
  must be verified before approval. Verification requires the submission of a
  clear and continuous screen recording showing:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>The start of the game session</li>
  <li>Uninterrupted gameplay</li>
  <li>The final qualifying score clearly visible</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Edited, shortened, accelerated, or manipulated recordings will not be accepted.
  BusinessPal reserves the right to request additional verification where necessary
  or to reject any submission deemed unfair, automated, or invalid.
</p>

<p>
  Rewards are limited to one per individual or business and are subject to
  availability, suitability of project scope, and BusinessPal’s discretion.
  BusinessPal reserves the right to amend, suspend, or withdraw game-based
  promotions at any time without prior notice.
</p>

<p>
  Participation in any game-based promotion does not create a contractual
  obligation or guarantee of service.
